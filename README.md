When integrated with a web crawler in Python, the PorterStemmer (from the nltk library) processes the textual 
content extracted from web pages by reducing words to their root or base form. After the web crawler collects 
and parses page data—usually using libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup—the text can be tokenized and passed 
through the PorterStemmer to standardize word variations (e.g., "running" → "run", "better" → "better"). 
This helps normalize the dataset, making tasks like keyword matching, indexing, and search more efficient and
accurate, as it reduces redundant variations of the same term.
